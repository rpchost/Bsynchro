The API will expose an endpoint which accepts the user information (customerID, initialCredit).

• Once the endpoint is called, a new account will be opened connected to the user whose ID is
customerID.

• Also, if initialCredit is not 0, a transaction will be sent to the new account.

• Another Endpoint will output the user information showing Name, Surname, balance, and
transactions of the accounts.
